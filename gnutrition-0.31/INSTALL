REQUIREMENTS

    GNUTRITION is written is Python. It requires the following:

      * The Python bindings to GTK+ and GNOME.

      * MySQL database server and client - version 3.22 or above.
        At present gnutrition requires a locally installed server.

      * MySQLdb modules - a Python interface to MySQL.
        The home page is at http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb and
        the latest version can be downloaded from:
            http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb/0.3.5


UPGRADING

    Note that if you are upgrading from version 0.2 to 0.3 or above, 
    gnutrition now uses a MySQL database to store recipes. This means that 
    recipes created with version 0.2 cannot be loaded into 0.3. They must be
    re-created using version 0.3. Sorry.

    In future versions, if the database table format is changed, I will
    provide smoother way to upgrade between without losing data.

INSTALLATION

    To compile and install gnutrition

        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

    should work, and will install into

        /usr/local/bin
        /usr/local/share
	
    Use the `--prefix' command line option to install elsewhere. 
    For example to install in your home directory:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr
        make
        make install

    After installing gnutrition, you will need to make sure that
    MySQL is set up properly, especially if you have installed
    MySQL for the first time.

    MySQL uses an access privilege system. When it is installed, the
    initial root password is empty. To get gnutrition working, all you
    need to do is make sure that you specify a root password.

    To save you the trouble of reading the MySQL manual, this can be
    achieved as follows:

    From a shell prompt type:

        mysql -uroot mysql

    You should now get a MySQL prompt of "mysql>".

    From then MySQL prompt type the following lines:

        mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password') 
                    WHERE user='root';
        mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        mysql> quit

    Note that in the UPDATE line above, the single quotes are needed
    around new_password and root.

    That's it! You can now type "gnutrition".
