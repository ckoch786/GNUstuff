<para>This list looks daunting, but all of these packages should be
standard on modern Linux systems, but you may have to install MySQL
separately.
</para>
</sect2></sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Setting up <application>MySQL</application></title>
<para> Some steps are required to get the <application>MySQL</application>
database system running.</para>
<para>First, make sure you have the MySQL server daemon running.
Check under <filename>/etc/rc.d/</filename>, or run <application>Linuxconf</application></para>

<sect2>
<title>Bug on RedHat 7.0</title>
<para>On RedHat 7.0, I found a subtle error in the MySQL install.
Run this command as root to fix it:
<screen>
<prompt>#</prompt><userinput>chmod 755 /var/lib/mysql</userinput>
</screen>
</para></sect2>
<sect2><title>Setting the server root password</title>
<para>You must now log in to the <application>MySQL</application> server and
 set up a root password:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>#</prompt><userinput>mysql -uroot mysql</userinput>
<prompt>mysql&gt;</prompt><userinput>UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password') 
                    WHERE user='root';</userinput>
<prompt>mysql&gt;</prompt><userinput>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</userinput>
<prompt>mysql&gt;</prompt><userinput>quit</userinput>
</screen>
<para><application>MySQL</application> is now ready to run.</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Running Gnutrition for the First Time</title>
<para>
Start Gnutrition for the command-line simply:
<screen>
<prompt>$</prompt><userinput>gnutrition</userinput>
</screen>
</para>
<sect2><title>Installing the Database</title>
<para>When Gnutrition starts for the first time, it prompts for the
<application>MySQL</application> root password you typed in before.

<screenshot><graphic fileref="db_login.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
</para>
<para>Gnutrition will then install its nutrient database, which will
take a short time.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2><title>Entering your Information</title>
<para>
<screenshot><graphic fileref="details.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
This screen allows to enter your height, sex and weight, this is needed
to calculate your dietary requirements.</para>
<para>Gnutrition will then move to the main screen.</para>
</sect2></sect1>

   </chapter>

<chapter><title>The Main Window</title>
<para>This window is what you see first on starting Gnutrition:
<screenshot><graphic fileref="main.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
On the left hand side, three icons are visible for the three modes:
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Daily Record</term><listitem><para>List of foods eaten in a day,
to calculate total intake</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Recipe</term>
<listitem><para>Views a particular recipe.</para>
</listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Food</term><listitem><para>Analyses a Single Food</para>
</listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist></para>

<sect1 id=foodwin><title>The Single Food</title>
<para>The Single Food screen is good place to start.
By clicking in the ``single banana'' icon, this screen in displayed:
<screenshot><graphic fileref="single.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
This allows you to enter a particular food and receive a report about its 
nutrient content.
</para>

<sect2><title>Searching for a Food</title>
<para>Gnutrition can only analyse the foods present in its database. 
Press the ``Search'' button, to show the search window:
<screenshot><graphic fileref="food_srch.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
As this box shows, you may search by the text name or by 
the nutrient content.</para>

<sect3><title>Search by Text</title>

<para>In this example, I searched by the word ``apple''

The database produces dozens of options for this word, such as
``Babyfood, fruit, applesauce, strained'', or ``Pie, apple, prepared from recipe''
This are displayed in a tree format, with the first word forming the header, 
the second the sub-header, etc. You must explore the tree to find the one 
you what, cicking on the little pluses, explodes the sub-hierarchy of foods.

In this example, I have selected ``Apples, raw, with skin'':
<screenshot><graphic fileref="apple.jpg"></graphic></screenshot></para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Search by Nutrient Value</title>
<para>
In the ``Search'' window, ``Nutrient Search'' can be selected:
<screenshot><graphic fileref="nutr_srch.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
</para>
<para>Foods are selected by their nutrient content. ``Content'' can be assessed
by grams (weight), or calories (energy).</para>
<para>You can maximise nutrients, selecting foods rich in those nutrients, or
minimise nutrients, selecting foods low in that nutrient. 
</para><para>The ``constraint''
refers to a weighting given to each nutrient in computing its score.
So nutrient with a constraint of 3 will be three times as important in 
calculating the score, as one with a constraint of 1.</para>
<para> The minimised nutrients have a negative constraint, as they subtract 
from the score. The search gives the foods with the highest score
by this method.</para>
<para>The foods are displayed in a tree as for the ``Search by Name'' box.
</para></sect3></sect2>
<sect2><title>Back to The Main Window</title>
<para>When you have found the food you what, press the ``OK'' button, 
and you will return to the main screen with your food selected:
<screenshot><graphic fileref="apple_result.jpg"></graphic></screenshot>
You must first select the unit you are measuring in, in this case I have selected "large" (i.e. large apple), and the amount, in this case one.</para><para>
Results are then shown for lots of nutrients. Different classes of nutrients
are selected by the tabs ``Macro-nutrients'', ``Minerals'', etc.
The percentage of RDI (recommended daily intake) is also displayed for the nutrients
based on your height and weight as entered when you first ran the program.</para>
<para>To understand what all these mean, refer to the <link linkend=notes>
Nutrient Notes</link>.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id=recipewin><title>The Recipe</title>
<para>The Recipe screen is for entering a list of foods and their
quantities. 
  <!--screenshot><graphic fileref="recipe_screen.jpg"></graphic></screenshot--></para>
<para>The foods are entered as described <link linkend=foodwin>above</link>.
After you have entered all the foods in the recipe,
you can press on the ``Compute'' icon, a nutrient report 
for the whole recipe is produced, again similar in format to a single food.
</para>
<para>Recipes can be saved to disk to form a collection of recipes, by
pressing on the ``Save'' icon. make sure you give the recipe a name and a category.
These saved recipes can be retrieved by typing in the name int the ``Recipe
Name'' box and pressing Search.</para>

<sect2><title>Submitting a Recipe</title>
<para>Recipes can also be saved to a central repository at 
  <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/"></ulink>, by clicking on the ``Submit'' icon.
I urge you to do this whenever
you create a recipe. This way, a reasonable collection of recipes can be included
with later versions of the program. Before you submit, you must click through a
copyright warning, to allow the recipes to be included in future versions.
  <!--screenshot><graphic fileref="copyright.jpg"></graphic></screenshot-->
Please do not submit copyrighted recipes!</para></sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id=planwin><title>The Daily Record</title>
<para>
For the seriously keen, you can enter in the computer every food you eat at various times of the day, and Gnutrition will calculate the total nutrient 
intake you have for that day.
<!--screenshot><graphic fileref="daily_record.jpg"></graphic></screenshot--></para>
<para>As with the Recipe screen, multiple foods are entered, corresponding
to the time of day eaten, and a total recipe intake for the day is calculated.
</para></sect1>

<chapter id=notes><title>The Nutrients in Gnutrition</title>
<para>This chapter contains some notes on the nutrients
analysed by Gnutrition. They are not a definitive guide,
for detailed information refer to a standard text of nutrition
or dietetics.</para>

<sect1><title>Caveat</title>

<para>
When researching the information for the Recommended Daily Intakes (RDIs).
 I found the information
conflicting but incomplete, so for some nutrients there may be a
European value, a US value, and a UN value. In general, I have chosen
the US value, in the hope this will be compatible with the database. 
</para><para>
If you know of a good reference for RDIs, I would be eager to hear from you,
mail me at
<email>ihaywood@gnu.org</email> 
</para><para>
It also should be noted that RDIs are a
<emphasis>guide</emphasis> 
to nutrition, not the definition of it. Individuals may
vary from the RDIs provided for many reasons. For example, active
people need more
energy and protein than inactive people, and illness increases the
RDIs for almost everything. 
</para><para>
In summary, just because the program spits out
a nice column of ``100%'', that doesn't automatically mean you have a healthy
diet. The old rules about balance and lots of green vegetables still
apply, I'm afraid. </para>
</sect1>  

<sect1><title>Macro nutrients</title>

<para>Macro nutrients constitute the bulk of the food we eat, they provide
energy and chemical building-blocks for tissues.</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Protein</term>
<listitem><para> Proteins consists of long chains of <link linkend=acids>
amino acids</link>
, to which it is broken down to in the digestive
system. Much of these amino acids are reconstituted by the body to
form human proteins. Human proteins are universal in the body: as
enzymes they regulate chemical reactions within cells and the blood,
they form tendons and ligaments which hold the body together, and they
provide muscle with its ability to contract. Excess protein can be
converted to sugar by the liver. 
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Carbohydrate</term>
<listitem><para> consists of sugar, and chains
of sugar molecules called starches. Starches are broken down in a
similar manner to protein. In plants and bacteria,
carbohydrates provide structure, but in animals they are used for
energy.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Fat</term>
<listitem><para> consists of fatty acids (<link linkend=lipids>lipids</link>), 
which are chain of
carbon atoms with a acid group at the end. These fatty acids are
linked in groups of three by glycerol. Once again,. this structure is
broken down in the gut, only to be re-formed in fat cells. Some fatty
acids have special functions, but mostly fat is a store of energy.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Alcohol</term>
<listitem><para>Rightfully a drug, but its energy component,
between fat and protein, 
can be significant in some people. There is no recommended intake for
alcohol, but their are recommended maximum intakes, these being 40g a
day for men and 20g a day for women. <footnote><para>according to the 
Drug and Alcohol Centre,
St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.</para></footnote>
</para></listitem></varlistentry> 

<varlistentry>
<term>Energy</term><listitem><para>A total calculated from the above, which is
expressed in both kilocalories (the traditional unit in chemistry), and
kilojoules (the physicist's unit). 
</para><para>
There is a base requirement for energy, which can be estimated by age
and weight. However, muscle mass requires more energy to maintain than
fat mass, so persons of the same weight can have widely different
base energy requirements. In addition, active people will obviously
need more energy. </para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Fibre</term><listitem><para> is indigestible
by human enzymes, and is largely excreted, or digested by bacteria in
the large intestine. Nevertheless, it is very important, and often 
deficient in first-world diets. It dilutes toxins that build up the
gut and retains water. It softens faeces and increases its volume,
making bowel motions more efficient. Deficiency causes constipation,
and has been linked to bowel cancer.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Water</term>
<listitem><para> Arguably the most important nutrient, in terms of
amount (two-thirds of the body), and essentiality 
(people die of thirst long before they starve).
</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist>
</sect1>
<sect1><title>Vitamins</title>
<para>
Vitamins are cofactors -- special molecules which support various
biochemical reactions with in the body -- required only in very small
amounts, and can be stored for extended periods. They are divided into
two groups:</para>

<sect2><title>Fat-soluble vitamins</title>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Vitamin A</term><listitem><para>
 is used for light-detecting chemicals in the
retina of the eye, and maintaining proper skin moisture and
softness. In deficiency, poor night vision, hard and rough skin, and
anaemia can occur. Vitamin A is also an anti-oxidant and protects
against cancer. 
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Vitamin D</term><listitem><para> 
regulates calcium. Deficiency leads to rickets
(soft, malformed bones) in children. With adequate sunlight, the body
can make its own vitamin D, so little or none is required by the
diet. It is not included in the USDA database, and so not analysed by
Gnutrition.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Vitamin E</term><listitem><para> is a strong anti-oxidant: it
destroys cancer-causing chemicals called @emph{free radicals}. 
No deficiency syndrome has been described.
 </para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Vitamin K</term>
<listitem><para> is used by the liver to make special proteins,
which circulate in the blood. When a person is injured, these proteins.
help to form a clot. Intestinal bacteria can make vitamin K, however,
it is also required in the diet, but in low amounts. It is not
included in the database.</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist>
</sect2>
<sect2><title>Water-soluble vitamins</title>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Vitamin C</term>
<listitem> <para> is used in making collagen, a tough protein that
provides a ``glue'' holding cells together. Vitamin C deficiency,
known as @emph{scurvy}, leads to easy bruising and bleeding, as
lack of collagen weakens blood vessels. It also aids the absorption of
of iron, and may be an anti-oxidant.
</para><para>
It is not a cure for the common cold.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine)</term>
<listitem><para> is used in the biochemical processes
by which cells obtain energy from sugar. Deficiency causes mental
disturbance, clumsiness, and double-vision, which can occur in
alcoholics, and in third-world countries. </para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Riboflavin</term><term>Niacin</term>
<term>Pantothenic acid</term><listitem><para> are also 
important in energy utilisation by cells, by forming parts of
different enzymes. Niacin deficiency causes @emph{pellagra}, characterised
to dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia.</para></listitem></varlistentry> 

<varlistentry><term>Vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine)
</term><listitem><para> is used for processing of amino
acids, deficiency causes a type of anaemia.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>Folate</term> 
<listitem><para> is used for the synthesis of DNA. Deficiency leads
to anaemia. In pregnant women, higher intakes protects against neural
tube defects in their children.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Vitamin B-12</term> 
<listitem><para> is also used for DNA synthesis, also leads to
anaemia when deficient. Only available in animal sources, so strict
vegans require supplementation.</para></listitem></varlistentry>       
</variablelist></sect2></sect1>

<sect1><title>Metals</title>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Iron</term>
<listitem><para> is used mainly in haemoglobin, a chemical that binds oxygen
in the blood, giving it its red colour. Deficiency, more common in
women, leads to mild anaemia.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
 
<varlistentry><term>Calcium</term><listitem><para>
 is used mainly in bones, to provide mechanical
strength. Low calcium intake has been linked to osteoporosis (weakening
of the bones) in old people.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Selenium</term><listitem><para> is essential to an anti-oxidant enzyme, which
works in a similar manner to Vitamin E.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Potassium</term><term>Sodium</term>
<listitem><para> are used to provide electrical
potentials across nerve and muscle cell membranes, also to provide
the necessary osmotic force in body fluids. Excess sodium was once
linked to high blood pressure, but this not emphasised today.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Magnesium</term>
<listitem><para> is used in controlling nerve impulses, deficiency
causes weakness and tremors.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Copper</term><term>Manganese</term><term>Zinc</term>
<listitem><para> combine with
specific proteins to form various different enzymes.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry></variablelist></sect1>

<sect1 id=acids><title>Amino acids</title>
<para>
Amino acids are the breakdown products of proteins. They are divided into two groups, essential and non-essential:

     </tgroup> 
</table></para>
<para>Deficiency of any of the nine leads to
wasting as proteins cannot be made without them. This usually only
occurs with a very monotonous vegan diet, where the chief food is a plant
that does not have one or more essential amino acid. A varied vegetarian
diet solves the problem. 
</para>
<para>The other amino acids can be synthesised by the liver.
The liver can also interchange two pairs: 
cysteine and methionine, and tyrosine and phenylalanine. This means a shortage of one can be made up from the other, so total as the total requirement is
met.</para>
<para>
Amino acid supplements are of no proven benefit over proteins
containing the amino acids (but are much more expensive).
</para></sect1>

<sect1 id=lipids><title>Lipids</title>
<para>
Lipids include fatty acids (breakdown products of fat) and
cholesterol. </para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Fatty acids</term>
<listitem><para> can be divided into three main groups:
saturated <footnote><para>`saturation' in this sense refers to hydrogen. Ask
an organic chemist.</para></footnote>, mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated.
With these
three the key is the <emphasis>ratio</emphasis> -- 
lots of saturated fatty acids,
relative to the others leads 
to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
</para><para>Their 
specific chemical structures are available in organic chemistry or biochemistry
textbooks, in general they consists of a vary chain of carbon-atoms, with
a carboxylic acid group at one end.</para><para>
 Fatty acids are used to make certain types of hormones, as well 
as to store energy. Two fatty acids, linoleic and alpha-linoleic acid, are 
essential for humans.</para></listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Omega-3, and -6</term>
<listitem><para>Some fatty acids are referred as "omega-3" and 
"omega-6". This refers to the location of a double bond from
the final (omega) carbon atom in the fatty acid.</para><para>
It is believed that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil, may have
beneficial health effects, but there is little hard evidence for this.</para>
</listitem></varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Cholesterol</term>
<listitem><para> can be made by the liver, so there is little dietary
need. When we eat cholesterol, the liver compensates by making less. Contrary 
to popular belief, dietary cholesterol seems to have little effect on
blood-cholesterol levels, instead saturated fatty acids seem to be more
important.</para></listitem></varlistentry> 

<varlistentry><term>Phytosterols</term>
<listitem><para> Not sure about these. Many be one and the
same as phyto-oestrogens, plant mimics of the female sex
hormone. Intake is believed to control symptoms of menopause.

    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</para>

    <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</para>

    <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

    <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</para>

    <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="2">
    <title>VERBATIM COPYING</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

    <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
    above, and you may publicly display copies.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="3">
    <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

    <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</para>

    <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</para>

    <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>

    <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="4">
    <title>MODIFICATIONS</title>

    <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the
    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,
    you must do these things in the Modified Version:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
      <listitem><para>Use in the Title Page
      (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
      Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if
      there were any, be listed in the History section of the
      Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version if
      the original publisher of that version gives permission.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>List on the Title Page,
      as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
      authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,

      five).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>State on the Title page
      the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the

      copyright notices.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Include, immediately
      after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
      permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
      License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve in that license
      notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover

      <listitem><para>Preserve the section
      entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating
      at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
      Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no
      section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
      the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given
      on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
      Version as stated in the previous sentence.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve the network
      location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a
      Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
      locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
      based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.  You
      may omit a network location for a work that was published at
      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>In any section entitled
      "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's
      title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
      each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
      given therein.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Preserve all the
      Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
      in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not
      considered part of the section titles.</para>

      <listitem><para>Delete any section
      entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be included in
      the Modified Version.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Do not retitle any
      existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with
      any Invariant Section.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    
    <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</para>

    <para>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</para>

    <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</para>

    <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by
    this License give permission to use their names for publicity for
    or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="5">
    <title>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released
    under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
    modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
    all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
    unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
    combined work in its license notice.</para>

    <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this
    License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced
    with a single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with
    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,
    or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section
    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
    the combined work.</para>

    <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
    "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
    entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
    "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
    must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="6">
    <title>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</title>

    <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and
    other documents released under this License, and replace the
    individual copies of this License in the various documents with a
    single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you
    follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of
    the documents in all other respects.</para>

    <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection,
    and distribute it individually under this License, provided you
    insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
    follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
    copying of that document.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="7">
    <title>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</title>
    
    <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
    separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
    Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
    other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</para>

    <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to
    these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than
    one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts
    may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
    aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
    aggregate.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="8">
    <title>TRANSLATION</title>

    <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
    4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires
    special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
    include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition
    to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may
    include a translation of this License provided that you also
    include the original English version of this License.  In case of
    a disagreement between the translation and the original English
    version of this License, the original English version will
    prevail.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="9">
    <title>TERMINATION</title>
    
    <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Document except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any
    other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
    Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full
    compliance.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="10">
    <title>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</title>

    <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised
    versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.  See <ulink
    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</ulink>
    </para>

    <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Document specifies that a particular
    numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to
    it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that specified version or of any later version that has
    been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    If the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 label="">
    <title>How to use this License for your documents</title>

    <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
    a copy of the License in the document and put the following
    copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

<blockquote><para>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".
</para></blockquote>

    <para>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant
    Sections" instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have
    no Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover
    Texts.</para>

    <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program
    code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
    choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public
    License, to permit their use in free software.</para>
