GENERAL INFORMATION

    This is version 0.31 of GNUTRITION, a recipe and food nutritional
    analysis application for GNOME.

    GNUtrition can be found on the main GNU FTP server:

    It can also be found on the GNU mirrors; please use a mirror if possible.
    The FTP mirror list is available at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.
    http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnutrition/ will automatically redirect to a 
    nearby mirror.

    The official web site is:

            http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutrition

    This is alpha software, so don't expect everything to work correctly
    or even at all.

REQUIREMENTS

    GNUTRITION is written is Python. It requires the following:

      * pygtk and python-gnome - the Python bindings to GTK+ and
        GNOME. These are included as part of Ximian GNOME. To download,
        visit http://www.ximian.com.

        Alternatively, their individual home pages are:
            http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/ and
            http://www.daa.com.au/~james/gnome/

      * MySQL database server and client - version 3.22 or above.
        At present gnutrition requires a locally installed server.

      * MySQLdb modules - a Python interface to MySQL.
        The home page is at http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb and
        the latest version can be downloaded from:
            http://dustman.net/andy/python/MySQLdb/0.3.5


UPGRADING

    Note that if you are upgrading from version 0.2 to 0.3 or above, 
    gnutrition now uses a MySQL database to store recipes. This means that 
    recipes created with version 0.2 cannot be loaded into 0.3. They must be
    re-created using version 0.3. Sorry.

    In future versions, if the database table format is changed, I will
    provide smoother way to upgrade between without losing data.
